title: "PASSION & PROCESS: THE THNK GUIDE TO MAKING IDEAS HAPPEN"
description: "Generating new ideas is easy, it’s developing truly original breakthrough ideas that’s hard. Whether it’s an everyday problem or a bold new concept, you first need passion and purpose to begin the disciplined pursuit towards invention, but that’s nothing without an effective creative process to transform that vision into reality. In this experiential session, THNK co-founder Lee Feldman, former CCO at global digital design agency Blast Radius, chronicles his own learnings that helped companies like IKEA, NIKE and Starbucks think differently — as well as sharing tried-and-true methods for overcoming common blockers, forming new connections and where to look for signs and weak signals. In this experiential session, co-presented by Creative Mornings Vancouver, this hands-on and entertaining 90 minutes is designed to invigorate your creative leadership, helping set new habits, awakening the senses and providing practical ways to envision a better future and to engage others in it."

title: "NERD JAM: THE CULTURE OF TRANSFORMATION - PART I"
description: "As a part of Vancouver Design Week, the Vancouver Design Nerds are hosting a two-phase Jam about how word-based street interventions can transform our city and preserve our cultural spaces.                              We’ll be gathering over potluck and creative juice (whatever is your poison) at the Hive on the evening of September 17th to nerd out on we can design and create small-scale projects that change the street-scape for the pedestrian through site-specific engaging typographical interventions and messaging while considering the endangerement of Vancouver’s cultural spaces for creatives and to make work that responds to the need for reflexive and reflective action around showcasing and sustaining these spaces. We’ll rapid prototype and make type-based interventions which will be then installed and showcased at Vancouver Design Week’s block party in Railtown on September 20th. Let’s get our Design-Nerd on!"
